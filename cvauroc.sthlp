{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is used for comparing predictive models, both in model selection and model evaluation.
This method is often applied in clinical medicine and social science to assess the tradeoff between model sensitivity and specificity. 
After fitting a binary logistic regression model with a set of independent variables, the predictive performance of this set of variables 
- as assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) from a ROC curve - must be estimated for a sample (the 'test' sample) that is independent 
of the sample used to predict the dependent variable (the 'training' sample). An important aspect of predictive modeling (regardless of 
model type) is the ability of a model to generalize to new cases. Evaluating the predictive performance (AUC) of a set of independent 
variables using all cases from the original analysis sample tends to result in an overly optimistic estimate of predictive performance. 
K-fold cross-validation can be used to generate a more realistic estimate of predictive performance. To assess this ability in situations 
in which the number of observations is not very large, {hi:cross-validation} and {hi:bootstrap} strategies are useful. {hi:cvauroc} implements
k-fold cross-validation for the AUC for a binary outcome after fitting a logit or probit regression model, averaging the AUCs corresponding to 
each fold and bootstrapping the cross-validated AUC to obtain statistical inference and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Furthermore, {hi:cvauroc} provides the cross-validated fitted 
probabilities for the dependent variable or outcome, and the sensitivity and specificity with their respective 95% CI, contained in three new 
variables named {hi:_fit}, {hi:_sen}, and {hi:_spe}. 

{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:pw} This option allows the user to include sampling weights (e.g. inverse-probability of censoring or treatment weights -IPCW or IPTW-).
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:Kfold} This option allows the user to set the number of random folds to an integer greater or equal than 0 (default = 10). 
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:Seed}  This option allows the user to set the random seed to an integer greater than 1 (default = 7777).
{p_end} 

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:Probit} This option allows the user to fit a probit rather than a logit model (default).
{p_end} 

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:Graph} This option allows the user to graph the cross-validated ROC curve and the ROC curves for the respective k folds specified by the user.
{p_end} 

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:Fit} This option allows the user to generate a new variable (_fit) containing the cross-validated probabilities for the dependent variable or outcome.
{p_end} 

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:Sen} This option allows the user to generate a new variable (_Sen) containing the cross-validated sensitivity and 95%CI for the independent variable or predictor.
{p_end} 

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:Spe} This option allows the user to generate a new variable (_Spe) containing the cross-validated specificity and 95%CI for the independent variable or predictor.
